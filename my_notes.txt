Originally written in Sumerian, it was translated into various Asian languages.\n\n2. **The Rosetta Stone**: Another widely accepted hypothesis points to the Rosetta Stone‚Äîan ancient Egyptian stone inscribed with a decree issued in 196 BC‚Äîas a significant early translation.\n\n3. **Saint Jerome**: However, the first formal translator whose identity and work are known was **Saint Jerome**.

The First Translations Translation was believed to be born somewhere in the region of Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Egypt, with some conflicting theories among translators about the precise region where the first translation was done. Let‚Äôs answer the most controversial questions on the history of translation in order to clarify the different theories that are considered: What was the first translation in history? One of the most accepted theories states that the first translation known was a poem called The Epic of Gilgamesh, originally written in Sumerian and translated into a variety of Asian languages. Another widely accepted hypothesis believes that the Rosseta Stone, an ancient Egyptian stone inscribed with a decree, issued at Memphis in 196 BC, was the first piece of translation. Although these theories contradict each other, we can state that the first reflections on the Translation discipline go back more than 2,000 years. Since then, it has evolved over time and has ended up becoming translation as we understand it today. What is the most translated book in history? Although it is hard to know exactly, the Bible is considered to be the most translated book in history, followed very closely by the Quran. This hypothesis is probably accurate, as most religious books are translated quickly into many languages to spread their ideas as fast as possible.","One of the most accepted theories states that the first translation known was a poem called The Epic of Gilgamesh, originally written in Sumerian and translated into a variety of Asian languages.","Throughout time we can find several proposals for categorization in translation.
